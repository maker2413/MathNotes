#+TITLE: Math Notes

This is just a repository where I can dump notes on various topics of
mathematics that I have written. I wouldn't call this repository entirely
useful, but if you find any use out of it be warned that I'm not claiming that
anything found in this repository is 100% accurate or complete as sometimes I'm
just jotting things down to be reviewed and revised later.

For notes that I have other topics feel free to browse any of the other "Notes"
repositories found on my GitHub or visit [[notes.ethancpost.com]].

* Topics
  Here are some of the topics I have:
  - [[./LinearAlgebra/README.org][Linear Algebra]]: The study of vector spaces and linear transformations.
